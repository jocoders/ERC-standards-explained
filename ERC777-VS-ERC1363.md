# ERC777 and ERC1363: Problem Solving and Issues

## ERC777: Enhancements and Challenges

### **What Problems Does ERC777 Solve?**

ERC777 is often considered an advanced version of the ERC20 token standard, introducing several key enhancements:

1. **Hooks for Smart Contracts**: ERC777 introduces hooks (`tokensToSend` and `tokensReceived`) that allow smart contracts to react to token transactions. This feature enables more complex and interactive smart contract designs.

2. **Improved User Experience**: The standard eliminates the need for a two-step transfer process (approve and transfer) found in ERC20, reducing user operations and potential errors.

3. **Prevention of Token Loss**: ERC777 can prevent accidental loss of tokens by rejecting transactions to incorrect addresses, a common issue with ERC20 where tokens sent to a contract address are lost if the contract is not designed to handle them.

### **Security Concerns with ERC777**

Despite its advancements, ERC777 has faced criticism primarily due to security concerns:

1. **Reentrancy Attacks**: The same hooks that add functionality also open up potential for reentrancy attacks, similar to those seen in The DAO hack.

2. **Over-engineering and Complexity**: Some developers believe that the added complexity of ERC777 makes it less secure and harder to implement correctly compared to simpler standards like ERC20.

3. **Incompatibility Issues**: While ERC777 is backward compatible with ERC20, its new features require additional considerations, which can lead to integration challenges.

## ERC1363: Introduction and Purpose

### **Why Was ERC1363 Introduced?**

ERC1363 was developed to address some of the limitations and issues found in both ERC20 and ERC777, focusing on improving interaction between tokens and contracts.

### **Key Features of ERC1363**

- **Simplified Interaction**: Like ERC777, ERC1363 allows tokens to be sent to a contract with a single transaction that also notifies the contract, simplifying the token-spending approval process.
- **Enhanced Security and Simplicity**: It avoids some of the complexities and security issues of ERC777 by not requiring a registry system like ERC1820 and focusing on straightforward contract interactions.

### **Issues with ERC777 Addressed by ERC1363**

- **Reduced Risk of Reentrancy**: By simplifying the interaction model and avoiding external dependencies like registries, ERC1363 reduces the surface for reentrancy attacks compared to ERC777.
- **Avoidance of Overhead Costs**: ERC1363 does not rely on a registry system, reducing the gas costs and complexity involved in managing additional system dependencies.

## Conclusion

Both ERC777 and ERC1363 offer significant improvements over the older ERC20 standard, each introducing features that enhance token usability and smart contract interaction. However, the choice between using ERC777 or ERC1363 depends on the specific needs and security considerations of the deployment scenario. ERC1363, in particular, provides a simpler and potentially safer alternative to ERC777, making it suitable for applications where contract interaction is frequent and security is a paramount concern.
